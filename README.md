Assignment: Creating graphs for your data

STEP 1: Create graphs of your variables one at a time (univariate graphs).

Univariate_bar_graph

Examine both their center and spread.

STEP 2: Create a graph showing the association between your explanatory and response variables (bivariate graph).

Your output should be interpretable (i.e. organized and labeled).

WHAT TO SUBMIT:

Once you have written a successful program that creates univariate and bivariate graphs, create a blog entry where you post your program and the graphs that you have created. Write a few sentences describing what your graphs reveal in terms of your individual variables and the relationship between them.
