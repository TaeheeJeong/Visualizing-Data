Most popular response was "gone shopping". The second common responses were "gone to a religious service or church-related event" and "talked about someone youâ€™re dating, or a party you went to".



STEP 2: Create a graph showing the association between your explanatory and response variables (bivariate graph).

The following bivariate bar graph shows the relationship between the experience with mom and how young adults feel about their life.

The y-axis scale close to 0 means positive, close to 1 means negative.

The group of "none" shows the highest fraction, which means most of the time or all of the time young adults feel that  "life was not worth living.".
The group of "worked on a project for school" shows the lowest fraction. However, since the count of the group is very few, it may does not reflect correctly. 
The second lowest fraction of group is "talked about your school work or grades" and following "gone to a religious service or church-related event".
